In our present digital era, the <span class="quote">"death of paper"</span> has become a plausible concept, widely expected to materialise sooner or later. The <span class="quote">"digitisation of everything"</span> explicitly threatens to supplant every single <span class="quote">"old"</span> medium <span class="bracket">(anything carrying content in one way or another),</span> while claiming to add new qualities, supposedly essential for the contempo- rary world: being mobile, searchable, editable, perhaps shareable. And indeed, all of the <span class="quote">"old"</span> media have been radically transformed from their previous forms and modalities – as we have seen happen with records, radio and video. On the other hand, none of these media ever really disappeared; they merely evolved and transformed, according to new technical and industrial requirements.
</p>

<p class="right">
The printed page, the oldest medium of them all, seems to be the last scheduled to undergo this evolutionary process. This transformation has been endlessly postponed, for various reasons, by the industry as well as by the public at large. And so the question may very well be: is printed paper truly doomed? Are we actually going to witness an endless proliferation of display screens taking over our mediascape, causing a gradual but irreversible extinction of the printed page?
It’s never easy to predict the future, but it’s completely useless to even attempt to envision it without properly analysing the past. Looking back in history, we can see that the death of paper has been duly announced at various specific moments in time – in fact, when- ever some <span class="quote">"new"</span> medium was busy establishing its popularity, while deeply questioning the previous <span class="quote">"old"</span> media in order to justify its own existence. In such moments in history, it was believed that paper would soon become obsolete.<br>
<span class="footnote"><em>(Historical note: paper as a medium was  rst invented by the Egyptians around 3500 BC using the papyrus plant, then de nitively established in China starting in the 2nd century CE, before it was com- bined with the revolutionary movable type print technology –  rst in- troduced, again in China using woodblocks, and later on by Gutenberg in Germany in 1455 using lead alloys).</em></span>
</p>

<p class="left">
Time and again, the established mass-media role of paper has been called into question by a number of media theorists and marketing experts, who attempted in various ways to persuade society at large to get rid of paper, and choose instead some newer and supposedly better medium. This ongoing process seems to have originated in the early 20th century, when the death of paper was predicted – probably for the  rst time – after centuries of daily use. The development of public electricity networks, which enabled the mass distribution of new and revolutionary media, inspired visions of a radical change in the <span class="bracket">(still two-dimensional)</span> media landscape, following a fashionable logic of inevitable progress which lives on to this day.
</p>

<p class="right">
So the death of paper – in retrospect, one of the most unfortunate
and embarrassing prophecies of the information age – has obviously
not happened. Various kinds of printed pages are still being produced
in huge quantities, and globally distributed, on a mass scale as well as
on a very personal level. Nevertheless, the role of the printed page has
radically mutated, from being a prevalent medium in its own right, to
being a complementary medium, sometimes used as a static repository
of electronic content.<br>
<br>
<span class="largequote">
  <strong>The printed page has become more valuable, less expendable.</strong>
</span>
  <br>
<br>
This is because the duplication processes associated with paper are still
limited and costly, and take up both space and time. Making a physical
copy of a book involves either reproducing it page by page – or
printing it from a digital file, again page by page. The result is a stack
of paper occupying a significant physical space, and space seems to
have become one of the most valuable resources in our consumptionoriented
age.
</p>

<p class="left">
Electricity, radio, TV, computers and the World Wide Web have
all affected, transformed and revolutionised the printed medium in
various ways; still, our attachment to the particular characteristics of
paper remains more or less intact. Nevertheless, networks are radically
changing the way paper is produced and consumed. Editors, for
example, must now select their printed content much more carefully,
because of the huge amount of free content available online.
Actually, paper and pixel seem to have become complementary to
each other; print is increasingly the medium of choice for preserving
the <span class="quote">"quintessence"</span> of the Web. The editor of printed material is the curator,
the human filter, the one who decides what should be saved on a
stable medium, and what should be left as a message in a bottle tossed
into the sea of the Internet. So the printed page, with its sense of unhurried
conclusiveness, allows to the reader to pause, to reflect, to take
notes, without having to rely on electricity. And paper is also being
used to preserve a substantial part of the digital culture, independently
of hardware or software, describing the new media from the technical
perspective of an old medium.
