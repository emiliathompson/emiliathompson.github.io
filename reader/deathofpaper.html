In our present digital era, the ‘death of paper’ has become a plausible concept, widely expected to materialise sooner or later. The ‘digitisa- tion of everything’ explicitly threatens to supplant every single ‘old’ medium (anything carrying content in one way or another), while claiming to add new qualities, supposedly essential for the contempo- rary world: being mobile, searchable, editable, perhaps shareable. And indeed, all of the ‘old’ media have been radically transformed from their previous forms and modalities – as we have seen happen with records, radio and video. On the other hand, none of these media ever really disappeared; they ‘merely’ evolved and transformed, according to new technical and industrial requirements.
The printed page, the oldest medium of them all, seems to be the last scheduled to undergo this evolutionary process. This transforma- tion has been endlessly postponed, for various reasons, by the industry as well as by the public at large. And so the question may very well be: is printed paper truly doomed? Are we actually going to witness an endless proliferation of display screens taking over our mediascape, causing a gradual but irreversible extinction of the printed page?
It’s never easy to predict the future, but it’s completely useless to even attempt to envision it without  rst properly analysing the past. Looking back in history, we can see that the death of paper has been duly announced at various speci c moments in time – in fact, when- ever some ‘new’ medium was busy establishing its popularity, while deeply questioning the previous ‘old’ media in order to justify its own existence. In such moments in history, it was believed that paper would soon become obsolete.
(Historical note: paper as a medium was  rst invented by the Egyptians around 3500 BC using the papyrus plant, then de nitively established in China starting in the 2nd century CE, before it was com- bined with the revolutionary movable type print technology –  rst in- troduced, again in China using woodblocks, and later on by Gutenberg in Germany in 1455 using lead alloys).
Time and again, the established mass-media role of paper has been called into question by a number of media theorists and marketing experts, who attempted in various ways to persuade society at large to get rid of paper, and choose instead some newer and supposedly better medium. This ongoing process seems to have originated in the early 20th century, when the death of paper was predicted – probably for the  rst time – after centuries of daily use. The development of public electricity networks, which enabled the mass distribution of new and revolutionary media, inspired visions of a radical change in the (still two-dimensional) media landscape, following a fashionable logic of inevitable progress which lives on to this day.
